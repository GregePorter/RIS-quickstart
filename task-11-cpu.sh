# Adding comments before, since inline comments break the script

# We are running the script at ~/RIS-quickstart/task-11.py seven times, with arguments of 10 30 100 300 1000 3000 10000
# -n Number of CPUs
# -q Which queue
# -m Which host group
# -G Which job group
# -J Name of the job, used when you run bjobs
# -M How much memory does the job get
# -N Sends you an email when the job is done with a job summary
# -u Where to send the email to
# -o Where to write the job output to. Skip this if you just want the output sent to your email
# -R Specifies that the job must run without a GPU, and with 4GB of memory. This should to be the same as the argument to -M
# -g Used for fare share scheduling, to limit too many simultaneous jobs from running
# -a Which docker container to run inside. By default, rapidsai/rapidsai:21.10-cuda11.0-runtime-ubuntu20.04-py3.8 is reasonable, is what Open OnDemand uses

# To run, we enter the RIS-quickstart folder and run task-11.py with the quickstart-env Conda environment and the SHAPE parameter
